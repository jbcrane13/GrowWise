# Circular Dependency Fix: KeychainManager & BiometricAuthenticationManager

## Problem
A circular dependency existed between `KeychainManager` and `BiometricAuthenticationManager`:
- `KeychainManager` line 19 referenced `BiometricAuthenticationManager.shared`
- `BiometricAuthenticationManager` line 23 referenced `KeychainManager.shared`
- This created an initialization deadlock risk

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Protocol Abstraction
Created `AuthenticationProtocols.swift` with:
- `KeychainStorageProtocol`: Defines keychain storage operations
- `BiometricAuthenticationProtocol`: Defines biometric authentication capabilities
- Both protocols marked with `@MainActor` for concurrency safety

### 2. Dependency Injection Pattern
- Removed direct singleton references between services
- Added dependency injection methods:
  - `KeychainManager.setBiometricAuthentication(_:)`
  - `BiometricAuthenticationManager.setKeychainStorage(_:)`

### 3. Dependency Container
Created `AuthenticationDependencyContainer` to:
- Manage service dependencies centrally
- Provide controlled access to services
- Ensure proper initialization order

### 4. Initialization Helper
Created `AuthenticationInitializer` to:
- Wire up dependencies correctly at app launch
- Perform any necessary migrations
- Ensure services are properly connected

### 5. App Integration
Updated `GrowWiseApp.swift` to:
- Call `AuthenticationInitializer.initialize()` on app launch
- Ensure services are ready before use

## Files Modified

1. **New Files Created:**
   - `AuthenticationProtocols.swift` - Protocol definitions and dependency container
   - `AuthenticationInitializer.swift` - Service initialization helper

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `KeychainManager.swift` - Implements protocol, uses dependency injection
   - `BiometricAuthenticationManager.swift` - Implements protocol, uses dependency injection
   - `GrowWiseApp.swift` - Initializes services on app launch
   - `OnboardingNavigationView.swift` - Fixed unrelated UserProfile property access issue
   - `ValidationService.swift` - Made Sendable for concurrency safety

## Key Changes

### KeychainManager
- Now conforms to `KeychainStorageProtocol`
- Uses injected `BiometricAuthenticationProtocol` instead of direct reference
- Properties check for nil before accessing biometric features

### BiometricAuthenticationManager
- Now conforms to `BiometricAuthenticationProtocol`
- Uses injected `KeychainStorageProtocol` instead of direct reference
- Replaced `KeychainManager.KeychainError` references with its own error types

## Benefits

1. **No Circular Dependencies**: Services can be initialized independently
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
3. **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations without changing consumers
4. **Type Safety**: Protocol constraints ensure correct usage
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Testing

The fix was verified by:
1. Successfully building the project
2. Launching the app in iOS Simulator
3. Confirming no runtime initialization errors

## Future Improvements

1. Consider using a proper dependency injection framework (e.g., Swinject)
2. Add unit tests for the dependency injection setup
3. Consider making services configurable through environment
4. Add logging for service initialization debugging
