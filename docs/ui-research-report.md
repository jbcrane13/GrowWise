# GrowWise iOS App - UI Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides comprehensive research findings for the GrowWise iOS gardening app UI/UX design, focusing on modern iOS 17+ SwiftUI patterns, plant catalog interfaces, photo integration, reminder systems, and accessibility best practices. The research analyzes competitor apps, Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and current design trends to inform the app's development.

## 1. SwiftUI Navigation Patterns Analysis (iOS 17+)

### Migration to NavigationStack

**Key Finding**: iOS 17+ apps should use `NavigationStack` over the deprecated `NavigationView` for optimal performance and future compatibility.

#### Best Practices:
- **Independent Navigation Stacks per Tab**: Each tab should maintain its own `NavigationPath` for independent navigation histories
- **Router Pattern Implementation**: Use a central app router to coordinate navigation across tabs
- **Type-Safe Navigation**: Leverage enums with `Hashable` conformance for compile-time safety

#### Recommended Architecture:
```swift
// Separate NavigationPath for each tab
@State private var plantsNavigationPath = NavigationPath()
@State private var journalNavigationPath = NavigationPath()
@State private var remindersNavigationPath = NavigationPath()

TabView {
    NavigationStack(path: $plantsNavigationPath) {
        PlantCatalogView()
            .navigationDestination(for: Plant.self) { plant in
                PlantDetailView(plant: plant)
            }
    }
    .tabItem { Label("Plants", systemImage: "leaf") }
    
    NavigationStack(path: $journalNavigationPath) {
        JournalView()
    }
    .tabItem { Label("Journal", systemImage: "book") }
}
```

#### Implementation Benefits:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Deep linking support
- Preserved user context across tabs
- Scalable navigation logic
