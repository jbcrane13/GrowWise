# Lessons Learned - GrowWise Development

## üß† Development Insights & Patterns

### Session: 2025-08-19 (Initial Setup)

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Swift Package Manager**: Good modular approach with GrowWisePackage
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between Models, Services, Views
- **Core Data + CloudKit**: Appropriate choice for offline-first with sync

#### Patterns to Follow
- ‚úÖ MVVM architecture with SwiftUI
- ‚úÖ TDD approach for all new features
- ‚úÖ Modular package structure
- ‚úÖ CloudKit for data synchronization
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive PRD driving development

#### Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Don't skip build verification between features
- ‚ùå Don't implement without proper testing  
- ‚ùå Don't deviate from PRD MVP scope without documentation
- ‚úÖ **UPDATED**: PRD changed to iOS 17.0+ - SwiftData is perfect choice for modern features

#### Technical Notes
- Project structure suggests experienced iOS developer setup
- Good foundation for scaling with comprehensive feature set
- Need to verify all dependencies and build configuration

#### Quality Gates
- [ ] All code must build successfully in simulator
- [ ] TDD: Tests written before implementation
- [ ] MVVM: Proper separation maintained
- [ ] Performance: Keep under 2-second launch time requirement

#### Future Considerations
- Consider AI/ML integration for plant identification (Phase 4)
- Plan for accessibility requirements early
- Localization infrastructure needs early setup
