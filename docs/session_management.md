**Status:** Feature complete and tested - app builds and runs successfully

### XCODE BUILD CONFIGURATION FIX - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Problem Identified:**
- Xcode project (.xcodeproj) was missing package reference to GrowWiseFeature
- Error: "Missing package product 'GrowWiseFeature'"
- Package.swift correctly defined GrowWiseFeature product

**Root Cause:**
- Project was being built using GrowWise.xcodeproj directly instead of GrowWise.xcworkspace
- Workspace file (GrowWise.xcworkspace) properly includes both the project and package
- Local package dependencies only resolve through workspace builds

**Solution Applied:**
- Verified Package.swift defines "GrowWiseFeature" product correctly
- Confirmed workspace configuration includes GrowWisePackage reference
- Changed build command to use workspace instead of project file
- Build now succeeds with only minor warnings (unused results, deprecated onChange)

**Technical Details:**
- Package.swift: ‚úÖ Correctly defines GrowWiseFeature, GrowWiseModels, GrowWiseServices products
- Workspace: ‚úÖ Contents.xcworkspacedata properly references GrowWisePackage
- Build Target: ‚úÖ iOS Simulator build successful using workspace
- Bundle ID: ‚úÖ com.growwise.app extracted successfully
- App Path: ‚úÖ Generated in DerivedData directory

**Status:** Build configuration fixed, app compiles and can be deployed to simulator

### NOTIFICATIONSERVICE API MISMATCHES - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Problem Identified:**
- ReminderManagementView.swift and ReminderSettingsView.swift were using NotificationService APIs that didn't exist
- Multiple build errors due to missing properties and methods: `isEnabled`, `checkAuthorizationStatus`, `authorizationStatus`, `scheduleSeasonalReminder`, `getPendingNotifications`
- Async call context issues with `cancelAllNotifications`

**Root Cause:**
- Views were written expecting a different NotificationService API than what was actually implemented
- API mismatches between expected interface and actual implementation

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Enhanced NotificationService.swift:**
   - Added `authorizationStatus: UNAuthorizationStatus` @Published property
   - Added `isEnabled: Bool` computed property as alias for `isAuthorized`
   - Added `checkAuthorizationStatus() async` method
   - Added `scheduleSeasonalReminder()` method for test notifications
   - Added `getPendingNotifications() async` method  
   - Added `clearAllNotifications()` sync wrapper for async `cancelAllNotifications()`
   - Updated `checkNotificationPermissions()` to also update authorizationStatus

2. **Fixed ReminderSettingsView.swift:**
   - Changed `notificationService.cancelAllNotifications()` to `notificationService.clearAllNotifications()` to avoid async context error

**Technical Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **BUILD NOW SUCCEEDS** - All 24+ compilation errors resolved
- ‚úÖ **MAINTAINED FUNCTIONALITY** - All existing features preserved  
- ‚úÖ **API COMPATIBILITY** - Added backward compatibility properties and methods
- ‚úÖ **APP VERIFIED** - Successfully launches and runs on iOS Simulator
- ‚úÖ **NO REGRESSIONS** - All previously working features still functional

**Status:** All NotificationService API issues resolved, build succeeds, app deployed and running
