# Session Management - GrowWise iOS Development

## ðŸš€ Session Start: 2025-08-25T10:00:00.000Z
## ðŸŽ¯ Current Update: 2025-08-25T10:00:00.000Z

### Current Status
- **Project**: GrowWise - Comprehensive iOS Gardening App
- **Phase**: Security Enhancement (Key Rotation Implementation)
- **Branch**: master (ahead by 1 commit)
- **Architecture**: SwiftUI + Swift Package Manager + Core Data + CloudKit + Secure Enclave

### Session Objectives
1. ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT**: Implement comprehensive key rotation mechanism with versioning support
2. ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT**: Design PCI DSS and SOC2 compliant key management system
3. ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT**: Create KeyRotationManager with automatic rotation policies
4. ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT**: Add compliance reporting and audit trail functionality
5. ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT**: Implement gradual data re-encryption during rotation
6. ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT**: Support multiple active keys for backward compatibility

### Implementation Requirements
- KeyRotationManager class with versioned key storage
- Automatic key rotation policies (configurable intervals)
- Multiple active keys support for decryption
- Single current key for new encryption operations
- Key metadata (creation date, rotation date, version)
- Gradual data re-encryption during rotation
- Compliance reporting for key age and rotation history
- Audit trail for rotation events

### Modified Files This Session
- EncryptionService.swift (to be enhanced with rotation support)
- KeyRotationManager.swift (to be created)

### Build/Test Status
- âœ… **PROJECT BUILDS SUCCESSFULLY** - Clean builds with iOS Simulator
- âœ… **APP LAUNCHES AND RUNS** - No crashes, fully functional
- âœ… **EXISTING ENCRYPTION WORKS** - Secure Enclave integration functional
- ðŸ”„ **READY FOR**: Key rotation security enhancement

### Current Blockers
- None - Ready to proceed with key rotation implementation

### RESUME POINT
**CONTEXT:** Implementing comprehensive key rotation mechanism for PCI DSS and SOC2 compliance.
**NEXT STEPS:** 
1. Create KeyRotationManager with versioned key storage
2. Enhance EncryptionService with rotation support
3. Add compliance reporting and audit trail
4. Implement gradual data re-encryption
