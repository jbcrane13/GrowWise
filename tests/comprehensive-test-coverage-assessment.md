## Conclusion

The GrowWise iOS app has a solid foundation for testing but requires significant investment in comprehensive test coverage. The immediate focus should be on critical service layer testing, particularly LocationService, PhotoService, and ReminderService, which have zero coverage despite being core to the app's functionality.

The existing test infrastructure is well-designed and can support rapid expansion. With focused effort over the next 2-3 months, the app can achieve production-ready test coverage and significantly improve reliability and maintainability.

**Immediate Priority**: Implement LocationService and PhotoService test suites to address the most critical coverage gaps and reduce high-risk areas.
